Substrings

substring is used to take a part of a string. Syntax:substring(first_index,last_index).

  var a = "Hello world!";
  console.log(a.substring(1,6));
The preceding code snippet gives "ello".Note that the "w"(index 6) is not part of this substring.

We could also do,

  var a = "Hello world!";
  console.log(a.substring(2));

This gives the whole string from the character with index 2.
the result is "llo world!".

##substr
There is also a method substr() that works slightly differently. Instead of the second number being an index number, it gives the number of characters.
Syntax:substr(start_index,end_index);

var a = 'Hello world!';
document.write(a.substr(1,6));
starts at the character with index 1 ('e') and then gives 6 characters, so the output is ello w
